Description: Doubly robust estimation and inference of log hazard ratio under the Cox marginal structural model with informative censoring. An augmented inverse probability weighted estimator that involves 3 working models, one for conditional failure time T, one for conditional censoring time C and one for propensity score. Both models for T and C can depend on both a binary treatment A and additional baseline covariates Z, while the propensity score model only depends on Z. With the help of cross-fitting techniques, achieves the rate-doubly robust property that allows the use of most machine learning or non-parametric methods for all 3 working models, which are not permitted in classic inverse probability weighting or doubly robust estimators.
